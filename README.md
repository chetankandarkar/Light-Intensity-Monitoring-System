# Light-Intensity-Monitoring-System
Bolt Cloud Project

Aim : Visualize the data from the LDR in different graph format.

Hardware Required
- Bolt IoT Module
- Micro USB Cable
- LDR (2 legged devicewith a red wave pattern disk on top)
- 10k Ohm Resistor (brown black orange color code)

## Procedure 
1) Do the Circuit Connection :
- Insert one lead of the LDR into the Bolt Module's 3v3 Pin.
- Insert other lead of the LDR into the A0 pin.
- Insert one leg of the 10k Ohm resistor into the GND pin
- Insert the other leg of the resistor also into the A0 pin
